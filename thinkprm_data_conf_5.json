      "Let's verify step by step:\n\n",
      "Step 1: To simplify a fraction, I need to find the greatest common factor of the numerator and denominator and divide both by it.\n\nCritique: This is a correct approach to simplifying fractions. The greatest common factor (GCF) is indeed used to reduce fractions to their simplest form.\n\nThe step is \\boxed{correct}<confidence>1.00</confidence>",
      "\n\n",
      "Step 2: A common factor is a number that divides evenly into both the numerator and denominator.\n\nCritique: This definition is accurate. A common factor is any number that can divide both the numerator and the denominator without leaving a remainder.\n\nThe step is \\boxed{correct}<confidence>1.00</confidence>",
      "\n\n",
      "Step 3: To find the greatest common factor, I can use the prime factorization method, which means breaking down both numbers into products of prime factors.\n\nCritique: This is a valid method for finding the GCF. Prime factorization helps identify all the prime factors of each number, making it easier to spot the common ones.\n\nThe step is \\boxed{correct}<confidence>1.00</confidence>",
      "\n\n",
      "Step 4: A prime number is a number that has only two factors: itself and 1.\n\nCritique: This is the correct definition of a prime number. Prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves.\n\nThe step is \\boxed{correct}<confidence>1.00</confidence>",
      "\n\n",
      "Step 5: The prime factorization of 91 is 7 times 13, since both 7 and 13 are prime.\n\nCritique: This is accurate. 91 divided by 7 is 13, and both 7 and 13 are prime numbers.\n\nThe step is \\boxed{correct}<confidence>1.00</confidence>",
      "\n\n",
      "Step 6: The prime factorization of 26 is 2 times 13, since both 2 and 13 are prime.\n\nCritique: This is also correct. 26 divided by 2 is 13, and both 2 and 13 are prime numbers.\n\nThe step is \\boxed{correct}<confidence>1.00</confidence>",
      "\n\n",
      "Step 7: Now I can write the fraction as a product of prime factors: \\(\\frac{91}{26} = \\frac{7 \\times 13}{2 \\times 13}\\).\n\nCritique: This step correctly expresses the fraction using its prime factors.\n\nThe step is \\boxed{correct}<confidence>1.00</confidence>",
      "\n\n",
      "Step 8: I can see that 13 is a common factor of both the numerator and denominator, so I can divide both by 13.\n\nCritique: Identifying 13 as a common factor is correct, and dividing both numerator and denominator by 13 is the right step to simplify the fraction.\n\nThe step is \\boxed{correct}<confidence>1.00</confidence>",
      "\n\n",
      "Step 9: This gives me \\(\\frac{7}{2}\\).\n\nCritique: After canceling out the common factor of 13, the fraction becomes \\(\\frac{7}{2}\\), which is correct.\n\nThe step is \\boxed{correct}<confidence>1.00</confidence>",
      "\n\n",
      "Step 10: This is the simplest form of the fraction, since 7 and 2 have no common factors other than 1.\n\nCritique: 7 and 2 are both prime numbers, so their only common factor is 1, meaning the fraction is indeed in its simplest form.\n\nThe step is \\boxed{correct}<confidence>1.00</confidence>",
      "\n\n",
      "Step 11: I can also write this as a mixed number, which means a whole number plus a fraction.\n\nCritique: Converting an improper fraction to a mixed number is an optional step, but it's correctly mentioned here.\n\nThe step is \\boxed{correct}<confidence>1.00</confidence>",
      "\n\n",
      "Step 12: To do that, I need to divide 7 by 2 and write the quotient as the whole number and the remainder as the numerator of the fraction.\n\nCritique: This is the correct method for converting an improper fraction to a mixed number.\n\nThe step is \\boxed{correct}<confidence>1.00</confidence>",
      "\n\n",
      "Step 13: 7 divided by 2 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so I can write \\(\\frac{7}{2} = 3 \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nCritique: The division is correct: 2 goes into 7 three times with a remainder of 1, resulting in the mixed number \\(3 \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThe step is \\boxed{correct}<confidence>1.00</confidence>",
      "\n\n",
      "Step 14: # Answer\n\n3.5 or \\(3 \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nCritique: This is correct. \\(3 \\frac{1}{2}\\) is equivalent to 3.5 in decimal form.\n\nThe step is \\boxed{correct}<confidence>0.89</confidence>",
