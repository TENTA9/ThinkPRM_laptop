      "I've got this math problem and a proposed solution, and I need to review each step to see if it's correct or incorrect. The problem is: \"How many positive two-digit integers leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8?\" The proposed solution goes through a few steps, and I have to evaluate each one.\n\nFirst, the solution states: \"So if a number leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 8, it's of the form 8n+2.\" That seems right to me. When you divide a number by 8 and get a remainder of 2, it means the number is 2 more than a multiple of 8. So, expressing it as 8n+2 makes sense. So, step 1 is correct.\n\nNext, it says: \"So we want to know the number of positive two-digit integers of the form 8n+2.\" Yep, that follows from the first step. We're looking for two-digit numbers that fit this form. So, step 2 is also correct.\n\nThen, it suggests: \"I think we should just plug in numbers and see what happens.\" That's a practical approach for this problem. Since we're dealing with two-digit numbers, we can start plugging in values for n and see when 8n+2 gives us a two-digit number. So, step 3 is correct.\n\nNow, step 4: \"Ok let's start with n=1. 8*1+2=10 which is a two-digit integer.\" That's correct. For n=1, we get 10, which is indeed a two-digit number.\n\nStep 5: \"Let's try n=2. 8*2+2=18 which is also a two-digit integer.\" Again, correct. 18 is a two-digit number.\n\nStep 6: \"And let's keep plugging numbers until we get a three-digit number.\" That makes sense. We need to find the range of n for which 8n+2 is a two-digit number, so we should continue until we reach a three-digit number.\n\nStep 7: \"That would be n=13. Because 8*13+2=106.\" Hmm, let's check that calculation. 8 times 13 is 104, plus 2 is indeed 106, which is a three-digit number. So, that's correct.\n\nStep 8: \"So the number of positive two-digit integers of the form 8n+2 is 12.\" Wait a second, let's see. If n starts at 1 and goes up to 12, because n=13 gives a three-digit number, then there are 12 values of n that give two-digit numbers. But let's double-check.\n\nFor n=1: 8*1+2=10\n\nn=2: 8*2+2=18\n\nn=3: 8*3+2=26\n\nn=4: 8*4+2=34\n\nn=5: 8*5+2=42\n\nn=6: 8*6+2=50\n\nn=7: 8*7+2=58\n\nn=8: 8*8+2=66\n\nn=9: 8*9+2=74\n\nn=10: 8*10+2=82\n\nn=11: 8*11+2=90\n\nn=12: 8*12+2=98\n\nn=13: 8*13+2=106\n\nYes, n from 1 to 12 gives two-digit numbers, and n=13 gives a three-digit number. So, there are 12 such numbers. Therefore, step 8 is correct.\n\nFinally, the answer is boxed as 12, which matches our conclusion. So, the entire solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"

Multiplying both sides by the denominators is a way to eliminate fractions. However, it's important to note that $6x+5$ must not be zero, as division by zero is undefined.

Multiplying both sides by the denominator should eliminate the fraction.\n\n**Step 4:** Simplify both sides.\n\n27x + 45 = 30x + 25\n\nLet's check:\n\nLeft side: 9*(3x + 5) = 27x + 45\n\nRight side: 5*(6x + 5) = 30x + 25\n\nLooks good.\n\n**Step 5:** Subtract 27x from both sides.\n\n45 = 3x + 25\n\nYes, that leaves us with 45 = 3x + 25.\n\n**Step 6:** Subtract 25 from both sides.\n\n20 = 3x\n\nCorrect, 45 - 25 = 20.\n\n**Step 7:** Divide both sides by 3.\n\nx = 20/3\n\nThat seems fine.\n\nBut wait, I should check if this solution actually works in the original equation. Let's plug x = 20/3 back into the original equation to verify.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n√(3*(20/3) + 5) / √(6*(20/3) + 5) = √5 / 3\n\nSimplify inside the square roots:\n\n√(20 + 5) / √(40 + 5) = √5 / 3\n\n√25 / √45 = √5 / 3\n\n5 / (3√5) = √5 / 3\n\nLet's rationalize the denominator on the left:\n\n5 / (3√5) * √5 / √5 = (5√5) / (3*5) = √5 / 3\n\nSo, √5 / 3 = √5 / 3\n\nYes, it checks out.\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{20}{3}} \\]"

      "I've got this math problem to look at. The question is: \"What is the least three-digit whole number, the product of whose digits is 6?\" And there's a proposed solution that I need to review step by step. I have to critique each step and decide if it's correct or incorrect. I can't sum up at the end; I have to judge each step individually.\n\nAlright, let's see. The solution starts by saying, \"So we want the product of the digits to be 6. That means that the digits have to be 1, 2, and 3.\" Hmm, is that necessarily true? Well, the product of 1, 2, and 3 is indeed 6. But are these the only digits that can multiply to 6? Let's think about it. Could there be other combinations of three digits that multiply to 6? For example, what about 6, 1, and 1? That's 6*1*1=6. Or even 2, 3, and 1, which is the same as 1, 2, 3. So, yes, 1, 2, 3 is one combination, and 6, 1, 1 is another. Maybe there are more. Wait, what about 3, 2, 1? That's the same as 1, 2, 3. So, essentially, the unique digits are 1, 2, 3 and 6, 1, 1.\n\nSo, the statement \"That means that the digits have to be 1, 2, and 3\" is not entirely accurate because there's another combination: 6, 1, 1. So, this step is incorrect.\n\nNext step: \"But the number can't be just any arrangement of those digits. It has to be the smallest three-digit whole number. So the first digit has to be 1.\" Wait, is that necessarily true? Well, if we're looking for the smallest three-digit whole number with the product of digits equal to 6, then yes, we want the smallest possible hundreds digit, then tens digit, then units digit.\n\nBut hold on, the solution considers only positive numbers here. Does the problem specify that it's a positive number? The question says \"the least three-digit whole number,\" and whole numbers are non-negative integers, so it includes positive numbers and zero. But three-digit numbers start from 100 to 999, which are all positive. So, perhaps it's safe to consider only positive numbers.\n\nHowever, the solution later considers negative numbers as well. It says, \"Then the smallest three-digit whole number is the negative of the largest three-digit whole integer with the desired property. That's true. So, let's first find the largest three-digit integer with the desired property. That would be the number 321.\"\n\nWait, is 321 the largest three-digit number with digits multiplying to 6? Let's check: 3*2*1=6, yes. But is there a larger one? Let's see, 611 is 6*1*1=6, which is also 6. Now, 611 is larger than 321 because 611>321. So, actually, 611 is larger than 321. So, the largest three-digit number with digits multiplying to 6 is 611, not 321.\n\nMoreover, if we consider negative numbers, the smallest three-digit whole number would be the negative of the largest positive three-digit number with the desired property. So, if the largest positive three-digit number with digits multiplying to 6 is 611, then the smallest three-digit whole number would be -611.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the least three-digit whole number,\" and whole numbers are non-negative integers. So, perhaps the intention is to consider only positive numbers. But the solution considers negative numbers as well, which adds complexity.\n\nLet's try to untangle this.\n\nFirst, we need to clarify whether we're dealing with positive or negative numbers.\n\nIf we consider only positive numbers, then we need the smallest positive three-digit number where the digits multiply to 6.\n\nIf we consider negative numbers, then the smallest three-digit whole number would be a negative number, specifically the negative of the largest positive three-digit number with digits multiplying to 6.\n\nBut the problem says \"the least three-digit whole number,\" and whole numbers typically include only non-negative integers. So, perhaps negative numbers aren't considered here.\n\nLooking up \"whole numbers,\" they are indeed the non-negative integers, starting from 0 upwards. So, in that case, we should consider only positive three-digit numbers.\n\nTherefore, the smallest three-digit whole number would be the smallest positive three-digit number with digits multiplying to 6.\n\nBut the solution considers both positive and negative numbers, which might be causing confusion.\n\nLet me try to approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, confirm the possible combinations of digits that multiply to 6.\n\nAs established earlier, the possible combinations are:\n\n- 1, 2, 3\n\n- 6, 1, 1\n\nAre there any others? Let's see: if we have digits a, b, c such that a*b*c=6, and a, b, c are digits (i.e., integers from 0 to 9), then what are the possibilities?\n\nFirst, 0 cannot be included because the product would be 0, which is not 6.\n\nSo, digits are from 1 to 9.\n\nNow, factorizing 6, we have:\n\n6 = 1*1*6\n\n6 = 1*2*3\n\nAre there any other combinations? Let's see: 6=2*3*1, but that's the same as 1*2*3.\n\n6=3*2*1, again the same.\n\n6=6*1*1, same as 1*1*6.\n\nSo, essentially, only two unique sets of digits: {1,2,3} and {1,1,6}.\n\nNow, to form three-digit numbers, we can arrange these digits in different orders.\n\nFor {1,2,3}, the possible numbers are: 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321.\n\nFor {1,1,6}, the possible numbers are: 116, 161, 611.\n\nSo, all possible three-digit numbers with digit product 6 are:\n\n116, 123, 132, 161, 213, 231, 312, 321, 611.\n\nNow, to find the smallest among these, we simply order them numerically:\n\n116, 123, 132, 161, 213, 231, 312, 321, 611.\n\nSo, the smallest is 116.\n\nBut wait, the solution says to consider the negative numbers as well, making the smallest three-digit whole number the negative of the largest positive three-digit number with the desired property.\n\nIf we consider negative numbers, then the smallest three-digit whole number would be -611, since 611 is the largest positive three-digit number with digit product 6.\n\nBut, considering the definition of whole numbers, which are non-negative integers, perhaps negative numbers aren't included.\n\nTherefore, the smallest three-digit whole number with digit product 6 is 116.\n\nBut let's go back to the proposed solution and review each step.\n\nThe proposed solution says:\n\n\"So We want the product of the digits to be 6. That means that the digits have to be 1,2 and 3.\"\n\nThis is incorrect because, as we saw, the digits could also be 1,1,6.\n\nSo, step 1: Incorrect.\n\nNext: \"But the number can't be just any arrangement of those digits. It has to be the smallest three-digit whole number. So the first digit has to be 1.\"\n\nThis assumes that the digits are only 1,2,3, which is incorrect, as we've established.\n\nMoreover, even if considering only 1,2,3, the smallest number would be 123, but there are numbers like 116 which is smaller and also satisfies the condition.\n\nSo, this step is also incorrect.\n\nNext: \"Not necessarily. The number could be negative.\"\n\nThis is a valid point. If whole numbers include negative integers, then the smallest three-digit whole number could be negative.\n\nHowever, whole numbers typically include only non-negative integers.\n\nSo, this introduces uncertainty.\n\nNext: \"Then the smallest three-digit whole number is the negative of the largest three-digit whole integer with the desired property.\"\n\nThis is a correct statement if we consider negative numbers.\n\nNext: \"That's true. So, let's first find the largest three-digit integer with the desired property. That would be the number 321.\"\n\nThis is incorrect because, as we've seen, 611 is larger than 321 and also satisfies the condition.\n\nSo, this step is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the proposed solution has several inaccuracies and incorrect steps.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- The solution incorrectly limits the digit combinations to only 1,2,3.\n\n- It fails to consider the combination 1,1,6.\n\n- It mistakenly considers 321 as the largest three-digit number with digit product 6, when 611 is larger.\n\n- There is confusion about whether to consider negative numbers or not",
      "Step 1: So We Want the Product of the Digits to Be 6.\n\nAnalysis: This is a restatement of the problem. The goal is to find the least three-digit whole number where the product of its digits equals 6.\n\nConclusion: \\boxed{correct}\n\nStep 2: That Means That the Digits Have to Be 1, 2, and 3.\n\nAnalysis: This assumes that the only combination of digits whose product is 6 is 1, 2, and 3. However, this is not necessarily true. There could be other combinations of three digits that multiply to 6. For example, 1, 1, and 6 also multiply to 6.\n\nConclusion: \\boxed{incorrect}\n\nStep 3: But the Number Can't Be Just Any Arrangement of Those Digits. It Has to Be the Smallest Three-Digit Whole Number.\n\nAnalysis: This step acknowledges that the arrangement of digits matters for determining the smallest number, which is correct. However, since the previous step was incorrect, this consideration is based on a flawed premise.\n\nConclusion: \\boxed{incorrect}\n\nStep 4: So the First Digit Has to Be 1.\n\nAnalysis: This is generally correct for finding the smallest three-digit number, as starting with the smallest possible digit in the hundreds place would yield the smallest number. However, this assumes that the number is positive. If negative numbers are considered, the smallest number would be the most negative one.\n\nConclusion: \\boxed{incorrect} (because it doesn't consider negative numbers)\n\nStep 5: Not Necessarily. The Number Could Be Negative.\n\nAnalysis: This is correct. The problem asks for the least three-digit whole number, and negative numbers are smaller than positive numbers.\n\nConclusion: \\boxed{correct}\n\nStep 6: Then the Smallest Three-Digit Whole Number Is the Negative of the Largest Three-Digit Whole Integer with the Desired Property.\n\nAnalysis: This is logically sound. If we consider negative numbers, the smallest three-digit number would be the negative of the largest possible three-digit number where the product of the digits is 6.\n\nConclusion: \\boxed{correct}\n\nStep 7: That's True. So, Let's First Find the Largest Three-Digit Integer with the Desired Property.\n\nAnalysis: This is a correct approach.

Let's verify this. The product of digits in 321 is 3*2*1=6. However, is this the largest possible? Consider 611: 6*1*1=6, which is larger than 321. Similarly, 611 is larger than 321, and its digits multiply to 6. So, 611 is a larger number with the same property.\n\nConclusion: \\boxed{incorrect}\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe proposed solution contains several errors and incomplete reasoning. The correct approach should consider all possible combinations of three digits that multiply to 6, including those with digits other than 1, 2, and 3, such as 1, 1, and 6. Additionally, since the problem allows for negative numbers, the smallest three-digit whole number would be the negative of the largest three-digit number with digits multiplying to 6. The largest such positive number is not 321 but 611, as shown in the analysis.因此",
      "Alright, let's dive into this problem and the proposed solution step by step. The problem is: \"What is the least three-digit whole number, the product of whose digits is 6?\" And the proposed solution tries to find the answer by considering both positive and negative numbers.\n\n**Step 1:** \"So we want the product of the digits to be 6. That means that the digits have to be 1, 2, and 3.\"\n\n**Analysis:** This step is partially correct. The digits could be 1, 2, and 3 because 1*2*3=6, but it's not the only combination. For example, digits could also be 6,1,1 since 6*1*1=6. So, the statement that the digits have to be 1,2, and 3 is too restrictive.\n\n**Verdict:** \\boxed{incorrect}\n\n**Step 2:** \"But the number can't be just any arrangement of those digits. It has to be the smallest three-digit whole number. So the first digit has to be 1.\"\n\n**Analysis:** Assuming only the digits 1,2,3 are considered, making the first digit 1 would indeed give us the smallest number among arrangements of these digits. However, since there are other possible digit combinations like 6,1,1, we need to consider those as well.\n\n**Verdict:** \\boxed{incorrect}\n\n**Step 3:** \"Not necessarily. The number could be negative.\"\n\n**Analysis:** This is a valid point. If we consider negative numbers, the smallest three-digit whole number would be the negative of the largest three-digit positive number with the desired digit product.\n\n**Verdict:** \\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 4:** \"Then the smallest three-digit whole number is the negative of the largest three-digit whole integer with the desired property. That's true. So, let's first find the largest three-digit integer with the desired property. That would be the number 321.\"\n\n**Analysis:** First, we need to confirm if 321 is indeed the largest three-digit number with digits multiplying to 6. The digits of 321 are 3,2,1, and 3*2*1=6. But is there a larger number with digits multiplying to 6? Let's check 611: 6*1*1=6, and 611 is larger than 321. Similarly, 611 is larger than 321, so 611 is a larger number with the same product of digits.\n\n**Verdict:** \\boxed{incorrect}\n\n**Additional Analysis:** So, the largest three-digit number with digits multiplying to 6 is 611, not 321. Therefore, the smallest three-digit whole number, considering negatives, would be -611.\n\n**Final Answer:** The smallest three-digit whole number with the product of its digits being 6 is \\boxed{-611}",
      "Step 1: \"So We Want the Product of the Digits to Be 6. That Means That the Digits Have to Be 1, 2, and 3.\"\n\nAnalysis: This step is partially correct. The digits that multiply to 6 could indeed be 1, 2, and 3, since 1*2*3 = 6. However, it's not the only combination. For example, digits could also be 1, 1, and 6 (since 1*1*6 = 6), or 1, 3, and 2, etc. The step incorrectly assumes that only one combination of digits satisfies the condition.\n\nConclusion: \\boxed{incorrect}\n\nStep 2: \"But the Number Can't Be Just Any Arrangement of Those Digits. It Has to Be the Smallest Three-Digit Whole Number. So the First Digit Has to Be 1.\"\n\nAnalysis: This step is based on the previous incorrect assumption. However, within that assumption, the logic is correct. If the digits are 1, 2, and 3, arranging them in ascending order would give the smallest number, which is 123. But since there are other possible combinations of digits, this step is not entirely accurate.\n\nConclusion: \\boxed{incorrect}\n\nStep 3: \"Not Necessarily. The Number Could Be Negative.\"\n\nAnalysis: This step is correct. In the set of integers, negative numbers are considered smaller than positive numbers. Therefore, the smallest three-digit whole number with digits multiplying to 6 would be a negative number.\n\nConclusion: \\boxed{correct}\n\nStep 4: \"Then the Smallest Three-Digit Whole Number Is the Negative of the Largest Three-Digit Whole Integer with the Desired Property.\"\n\nAnalysis: This step is correct.

So, Let's First Find the Largest Three-Digit Integer with the Desired Property. That Would Be the Number 321.\"\n\nAnalysis: This step is partially correct. The number 321 has digits that multiply to 3*2*1 = 6, and it is a large three-digit number. However, we need to confirm if there is a larger number with digits multiplying to 6. For example, 332 has digits multiplying to 3*3*2 = 18, which is too high. 322 has 3*2*2 = 12, also too high. 312 has 3*1*2 = 6, which is acceptable, but 321 is larger than 312. Similarly, 231 is also 2*3*1=6, but again, 321 is larger. So, 321 seems to be the largest three-digit number where the product of the digits is 6.\n\nConclusion: \\boxed{correct}\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe solution provided has some correct insights but also contains inaccuracies. The main error is in limiting the digit combinations to only 1, 2, and 3, while other combinations like 1, 1, 6 or 2, 3, 1 are also possible. Additionally, considering negative numbers is correct, but the solution could be more thorough in exploring all possible digit combinations to ensure that 321 is indeed the largest possible positive three-digit number with the product of digits equal to 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The solution contains errors in assuming the only digit combination is 1, 2, and 3 and does not explore all possible combinations.}} \\]"

So, the problem is: \"What is the least three-digit whole number, the product of whose digits is 6?\" And the proposed solution goes like this:\n\n\"Solution:\n\nSo We want the product of the digits to be 6.\n\nThat means that the digits have to be 1, 2, and 3.\n\nBut the number can't be just any arrangement of those digits. It has to be the smallest three-digit whole number.\n\nSo the first digit has to be 1.\n\nNot necessarily.

So, let's first find the largest three-digit integer with the desired property.\n\nThat would be the number 321.\"\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\n**Step 1:** \"So We want the product of the digits to be 6.\n\nThat means that the digits have to be 1, 2, and 3.\"\n\n**Analysis:** Well, the product of digits being 6 doesn't necessarily mean the digits have to be 1, 2, and 3. For example, 6 could be factored into 6 and 1 and 1, or 2 and 3 and 1, or even other combinations. So, this step is not entirely correct. It's incomplete because it doesn't consider all possible combinations of digits that multiply to 6.\n\n**Conclusion:** \\boxed{incorrect}\n\n**Step 2:** \"But the number can't be just any arrangement of those digits. It has to be the smallest three-digit whole number.\n\nSo the first digit has to be 1.\"\n\n**Analysis:** This step seems to be focusing on positive numbers and trying to find the smallest one. However, the previous step was incorrect, so this buildsp on a flawed foundation. Moreover, it doesn't consider that the number could be negative, which might actually give a smaller value.\n\n**Conclusion:** \\boxed{incorrect}\n\n**Step 3:** \"Not necessarily. The number could be negative.\n\nThen the smallest three-digit whole number is the negative of the largest three-digit whole integer with the desired property.\n\nThat's true. So, let's first find the largest three-digit integer with the desired property.\n\nThat would be the number 321.\"\n\n**Analysis:** This step recognizes that negative numbers could be considered, which could lead to smaller values. It suggests that the smallest three-digit number would be the negative of the largest three-digit number with digits multiplying to 6. However, it directly states that 321 is the largest without showing why. Let's verify that.\n\nFirst, we need to find the largest three-digit number where the product of the digits is 6. To maximize the number, we should maximize the hundreds digit, then the tens, and then the units.\n\nPossible combinations of digits that multiply to 6 are:\n\n- 6,1,1\n\n- 3,2,1\n\n- 2,3,1\n\n- 1,6,1\n\n- 1,3,2\n\n- 1,2,3\n\nAmong these, the largest possible hundreds digit is 6, followed by 1 and 1, making the number 611. The solution says 321, which is incorrect because 611 is larger than 321 and also has digits multiplying to 6.\n\nTherefore, this step is incorrect because it identifies the wrong number as the largest three-digit number with the desired property.\n\n**Conclusion:** \\boxed{incorrect}\n\nOverall, the proposed solution has several flaws. It doesn't consider all possible digit combinations for the product of 6, incorrectly assumes that the first digit has to be 1 for positive numbers, and mistakenly identifies 321 as the largest three-digit number with the desired property when in fact 611 is larger and also satisfies the condition.\n\nA correct approach would be:\n\n1. Consider both positive and negative three-digit numbers since negative numbers are smaller than positive ones.\n\n2. For positive numbers, find the smallest three-digit number where the product of the digits is 6.\n\n3. For negative numbers, find the largest three-digit number where the product of the digits is 6, and then take its negative to get the smallest three-digit number.\n\n4. Compare the results from steps 2 and 3 to determine the overall smallest three-digit whole number with the desired property.\n\nLet's apply this correct approach.\n\nFirst, consider positive numbers.\n\nWe need the smallest positive three-digit number where the digits multiply to 6.\n\nTo minimize the number, we should minimize the hundreds digit, then the tens digit, and then the units digit.\n\nPossible combinations of digits a, b, c (where a is hundreds, b is tens, c is units) such that a * b * c = 6 and a, b, c are digits from 1 to 9 (since 0 would make the product 0).\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- 1,1,6\n\n- 1,2,3\n\n- 1,3,2\n\n- 1,6,1\n\n- 2,1,3\n\n- 2,3,1\n\n- 3,1,2\n\n- 3,2,1\n\n- 6,1,1\n\nNow, arrange these combinations in ascending order:\n\n- 116\n\n- 123\n\n- 132\n\n- 161\n\n- 213\n\n- 231\n\n- 312\n\n- 321\n\n- 611\n\nThe smallest positive three-digit number is 116.\n\nNext, consider negative numbers.\n\nWe need the largest three-digit number where the digits multiply to 6, and then take its negative.\n\nFrom the previous list, the largest positive three-digit number is 611.\n\nTherefore, the smallest three-digit whole number would be -611.\n\nNow, compare -611 and 116.\n\nClearly, -611 is smaller than 116.\n\nTherefore, the least three-digit whole number whose digits' product is 6 is -611.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-611} \\]",
      "Step 1: So We Want the Product of the Digits to Be 6.\n\nAnalysis: This is a restatement of the problem. The goal is to find the least three-digit whole number where the product of its digits equals 6.\n\nConclusion: \\boxed{correct}\n\nStep 2: That Means That the Digits Have to Be 1, 2, and 3.\n\nAnalysis: This assumes that the only combination of digits that multiply to 6 is 1, 2, and 3. However, there could be other combinations of three digits that multiply to 6. For example, 1, 1, and 6 also multiply to 6.\n\nConclusion: \\boxed{incorrect}\n\nStep 3: But the Number Can't Be Just Any Arrangement of Those Digits. It Has to Be the Smallest Three-Digit Whole Number.\n\nAnalysis: This step acknowledges that the arrangement of digits matters for determining the smallest number, which is correct. However, since the previous step was incorrect, this consideration is based on a flawed premise.\n\nConclusion: \\boxed{correct} (given the premise)\n\nStep 4: So the First Digit Has to Be 1.\n\nAnalysis: If the number is positive, the smallest three-digit number would start with the smallest possible digit in the hundreds place. However, the solution considers the possibility of negative numbers, which could make a negative number with a larger absolute value smaller than any positive number.\n\nConclusion: \\boxed{incorrect} because it doesn't account for negative numbers.\n\nStep 5: Not Necessarily. The Number Could Be Negative.\n\nAnalysis: This is correct. In the set of whole numbers, which includes negative integers, the smallest three-digit whole number could be negative.\n\nConclusion: \\boxed{correct}\n\nStep 6: Then the Smallest Three-Digit Whole Number Is the Negative of the Largest Three-Digit Whole Integer with the Desired Property.\n\nAnalysis: This is logically sound. If the number is negative, the smallest three-digit whole number would be the negative of the largest possible three-digit number where the product of the digits is 6.\n\nConclusion: \\boxed{correct}\n\nStep 7: That's True. So, Let's First Find the Largest Three-Digit Integer with the Desired Property.\n\nAnalysis: This is a strategic approach. By finding the largest positive three-digit number with the product of digits equal to 6, one can then determine the smallest three-digit whole number by taking its negative.\n\nConclusion: \\boxed{correct}\n\nStep 8: That Would Be the Number 321.\n\nAnalysis: Let's verify this. The product of digits in 321 is 3*2*1=6. To check if it's the largest, consider other combinations like 611 (6*1*1=6), but 611 is larger than 321. Also, 6*1*1=6, and 611 is larger than 321. So, 611 is larger than 321, but does it have the product of digits equal to 6? Yes, because 6*1*1=6. So, 611 is a larger number with the product of digits equal to 6. Therefore, 321 is not the largest three-digit number with the product of digits equal to 6.\n\nConclusion: \\boxed{incorrect}",
      "Alright, let's dive into this problem and the proposed solution step by step. The problem is to find the least three-digit whole number whose digits multiply to 6. The proposed solution suggests that the digits must be 1, 2, and 3, and that the smallest number is 123. However, it also considers the possibility of negative numbers, suggesting that the smallest three-digit whole number would be the negative of the largest three-digit number with digits multiplying to 6, which is -321.\n\nLet's break this down.\n\n**Step 1:** \"So we want the product of the digits to be 6. That means that the digits have to be 1, 2, and 3.\"\n\n**Analysis:** This step is partially correct. The digits do need to multiply to 6, and 1, 2, and 3 are digits that satisfy this condition since 1*2*3=6. However, it's not the only combination. For example, digits could also be 6,1,1 since 6*1*1=6. So, the statement is too restrictive. There are other possible combinations of digits that multiply to 6.\n\n**Conclusion:** \\boxed{incorrect}\n\n**Step 2:** \"But the number can't be just any arrangement of those digits. It has to be the smallest three-digit whole number. So the first digit has to be 1.\"\n\n**Analysis:** This step assumes that the number is positive and that the smallest number would start with 1. However, the problem specifies \"the least three-digit whole number,\" which could include negative numbers. Whole numbers typically include only non-negative integers, but the proposed solution considers negative numbers, which might be a confusion between whole numbers and integers.\n\n**Conclusion:** \\boxed{incorrect}\n\n**Step 3:** \"Not necessarily. The number could be negative.\"\n\n**Analysis:** This step acknowledges that negative numbers could be considered, which is important because negative numbers can be smaller than positive numbers. However, the term \"whole number\" generally refers to non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, 3, ...). If the problem includes negative numbers, it should specify \"integers\" instead of \"whole numbers.\" Assuming the problem allows negative numbers, this step is correct in considering them.\n\n**Conclusion:** \\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 4:** \"Then the smallest three-digit whole number is the negative of the largest three-digit whole integer with the desired property.\"\n\n**Analysis:** This step correctly recognizes that if negative numbers are considered, the smallest three-digit number would be the negative of the largest possible three-digit number with digits multiplying to 6. This is a correct logical step.\n\n**Conclusion:** \\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 5:** \"That's true. So, let's first find the largest three-digit integer with the desired property. That would be the number 321.\"\n\n**Analysis:** To find the largest three-digit integer with digits multiplying to 6, we need to maximize the hundreds digit, then the tens digit, and finally the units digit. Given that the product of the digits is 6, possible combinations are permutations of (1,2,3) and (6,1,1).\n\n- For (1,2,3), the largest number is 321.\n\n- For (6,1,1), the number is 611.\n\nComparing 321 and 611, 611 is larger because 6>3 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait a minute, but 6*1*1=6, which satisfies the condition. So, 611 is larger than 321.\n\nTherefore, the largest three-digit integer with digits multiplying to 6 is 611, not 321.\n\n**Conclusion:** \\boxed{incorrect}\n\nGiven this analysis, the proposed solution contains errors in identifying the possible digit combinations and determining the largest three-digit number with the desired property.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-611} \\]"

      "Alright, let's dive into this problem and the proposed solution step by step. The problem is about finding the probability that at least half of John's five children are girls, assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal.\n\nFirst, the solution suggests counting the number of ways John could have at least three girls. That makes sense because \"at least half\" of five children means at least three girls (since half of five is 2.5, and you can't have half a child, so rounding up to three).\n\nStep 1: If John has three girls, he must have two boys. The number of ways this can happen is calculated using the combination formula \\(\\binom{5}{3} = 10\\). That seems correct. The combination formula \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) gives the number of ways to choose k items from n without regard to order, which is exactly what we need here.\n\nStep 2: If John has four girls, he must have one boy. The number of ways for this is \\(\\binom{5}{4} = 5\\). Again, this looks right.\n\nStep 3: If John has five girls, he has no boys. The number of ways for this is \\(\\binom{5}{5} = 1\\). Correct again.\n\nStep 4: Adding up these possibilities, we get \\(10 + 5 + 1 = 16\\) ways to have at least three girls.\n\nStep 5: The total number of possible outcomes is \\(2^5 = 32\\), since each child can be either a boy or a girl, and there are five children. That makes sense.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the probability is \\(\\frac{16}{32} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nWait a minute, does that seem right? Let me double-check.\n\nI recall that in probability, when you have independent events, like the gender of each child, and each has a probability of 0.5 for being a girl, then the probability of having at least a certain number of girls can be calculated using the binomial distribution.\n\nSo, the probability of having exactly k girls in n trials is \\(\\binom{n}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability of having at least 3 girls out of 5 is:\n\n\\(P(X \\geq 3) = P(X=3) + P(X=4) + P(X=5)\\)\n\n\\(= \\binom{5}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5 + \\binom{5}{4} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5 + \\binom{5}{5} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5\\)\n\n\\(= 10 \\times \\frac{1}{32} + 5 \\times \\frac{1}{32} + 1 \\times \\frac{1}{32}\\)\n\n\\(= \\frac{10 + 5 + 1}{32} = \\frac{16}{32} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nSo, the solution seems mathematically sound.\n\nAlternatively, I know that for a binomial distribution with p = 0.5, the distribution is symmetric. So, the probability of having at least three girls is the same as having at least three boys, and since these two events are complementary (except for the case where exactly 2.5 are girls, which isn't possible), the probability should be 0.5.\n\nWait, but let's think about it differently. Is there any reason to doubt this result?\n\nSuppose I list all possible outcomes. Each child can be a boy (B) or a girl (G), and there are five children, so there are \\(2^5 = 32\\) possible sequences of B's and G's.\n\nThe number of sequences with at least three G's is indeed 16, as calculated: 10 with three G's, 5 with four G's, and 1 with five G's.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed \\(\\frac{16}{32} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that the probability of having at least three girls is the same as having at most two boys, which should also be 0.5 by symmetry.\n\nWait, but let's consider the general case. The probability of having at least \\(k\\) successes in \\(n\\) independent Bernoulli trials with success probability \\(p\\) is given by the cumulative distribution function of the binomial distribution.\n\nIn this case, \\(n=5\\), \\(k=3\\), and \\(p=0.5\\).\n\nThe formula is:\n\n\\(P(X \\geq k) = \\sum_{i=k}^{n} \\binom{n}{i} p^i (1-p)^{n-i}\\)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\(P(X \\geq 3) = \\binom{5}{3} (0.5)^3 (0.5)^2 + \\binom{5}{4} (0.5)^4 (0.5)^1 + \\binom{5}{5} (0.5)^5 (0.5)^0\\)\n\n\\(= \\binom{5}{3} (0.5)^5 + \\binom{5}{4} (0.5)^5 + \\binom{5}{5} (0.5)^5\\)\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, since \\(p = 0.5\\), \\(P(X = i) = \\binom{5}{i} (0.5)^5\\) for \\(i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\).\n\nSo, summing for \\(i = 3, 4, 5\\), we get \\(\\frac{10 + 5 + 1}{32} = \\frac{16}{32} = 0.5\\).\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct.\n\nI don't see any flaws in the reasoning or the calculations. The answer is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\]",

      "Alright, I've got this math problem to look at. Let's see what it's asking for.\n\n**Problem:**\n\nFor some positive integers \\( p \\), there is a quadrilateral \\( ABCD \\) with positive integer side lengths, perimeter \\( p \\), right angles at \\( B \\) and \\( C \\), \\( AB = 2 \\), and \\( CD = AD \\). How many different values of \\( p < 2015 \\) are possible?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe solution provided tries to solve this step by step, so I'll go through each part and see if it makes sense.\n\n**Step 1:**\n\nLet's call the length of \\( BC \\) \\( x \\) and the length of \\( AD \\) \\( y \\).\n\nThe perimeter of the quadrilateral is just \\( 2 + x + 2y \\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nWait a minute, the perimeter should be the sum of all sides. Given that \\( AB = 2 \\), \\( BC = x \\), \\( CD = AD = y \\), and let's say \\( DA \\) is something else, but according to the problem, \\( CD = AD \\), so \\( CD = y \\) and \\( AD = y \\). So the perimeter should be \\( AB + BC + CD + DA = 2 + x + y + y = 2 + x + 2y \\). That seems correct.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 2:**\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as \\( x + 2y = p - 2 \\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nYes, rearranging the perimeter equation \\( 2 + x + 2y = p \\) gives \\( x + 2y = p - 2 \\). That's algebraically correct.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 3:**\n\nLet's construct a point \\( E \\) such that \\( AE \\) is perpendicular to \\( CD \\).\n\nThen \\( AE \\) is equal to \\( x \\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis step seems a bit unclear. The solution introduces a point \\( E \\) without specifying its location. If \\( AE \\) is perpendicular to \\( CD \\), where is \\( E \\) located on \\( CD \\)? Without a clear definition of \\( E \\), it's hard to verify this step.\n\n\\boxed{incorrect}\n\n**Step 4:**\n\nIn triangle \\( ADC \\), we have that \\( x = AE \\) is one leg, \\( y = AD \\) is the hypotenuse, and \\( y - 2 = DE \\) is the other leg. Let's apply the Pythagorean theorem there.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis step assumes that \\( DE = y - 2 \\), but it's not clear why that would be the case. Also, the introduction of point \\( E \\) is still vague. Perhaps the solution is trying to drop a perpendicular from \\( A \\) to \\( CD \\), creating a right triangle, but without a clear diagram, it's difficult to follow.\n\n\\boxed{incorrect}\n\n**Step 5:**\n\nWe get \\( x^2 + (y - 2)^2 = y^2 \\).\n\nWhich is the same as \\( x^2 = 4y - 4 \\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nAssuming that the previous steps are correct, this algebraic manipulation looks right. Starting from the Pythagorean theorem applied to triangle \\( AED \\), where \\( AE = x \\), \\( DE = y - 2 \\), and \\( AD = y \\), we get \\( x^2 + (y - 2)^2 = y^2 \\), which simplifies to \\( x^2 = 4y - 4 \\).\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 6:**\n\nAnd we know that \\( p = 2 + x + 2y = 2 + 2\\sqrt{y - 1} + 2y \\) must be less than 2015.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nHere, the solution expresses \\( p \\) in terms of \\( y \\), but there's a mistake in the expression. From \\( x^2 = 4y - 4 \\), we can solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = \\sqrt{4y - 4} = 2\\sqrt{y - 1} \\). So, \\( p = 2 + x + 2y = 2 + 2\\sqrt{y - 1} + 2y \\). This part seems correct, but it's important to note that \\( y \\) must be such that \\( y - 1 \\) is a perfect square, since \\( x \\) is an integer.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 7:**\n\nSo, \\( 2\\sqrt{y - 1} + 2y < 2013 \\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nWait, the perimeter \\( p < 2015 \\), so \\( 2 + x + 2y < 2015 \\). Given that \\( x = 2\\sqrt{y - 1} \\), then \\( 2 + 2\\sqrt{y - 1} + 2y < 2015 \\). Subtracting 2 from both sides gives \\( 2\\sqrt{y - 1} + 2y < 2013 \\). This seems correct.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 8:**\n\n\\( y = 1 \\) doesn't work, since \\( x \\) must be a positive integer.\n\nBut \\( y = 2 \\) does work.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLet's check for \\( y = 1 \\):\n\n\\( x = 2\\sqrt{1 - 1} = 0 \\), but \\( x \\) must be a positive integer, so \\( y = 1 \\) is invalid.\n\nFor \\( y = 2 \\):\n\n\\( x = 2\\sqrt{2 - 1} = 2 \\), which is a positive integer. So, \\( y = 2 \\) works.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 9:**\n\nFrom the equation \\( x^2 = 4y - 4 \\), we get \\( y = (x/2)^2 + 1 \\). So, \\( y \\) is going to be of the form \\( y = n^2 + 1 \\), where \\( n \\) is an integer.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nGiven \\( x = 2\\sqrt{y - 1} \\), solving for \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 2\\sqrt{y - 1} \\)\n\n\\( x/2 = \\sqrt{y - 1} \\)\n\n\\( (x/2)^2 = y - 1 \\)\n\n\\( y = (x/2)^2 + 1 \\)\n\nSo, if we let \\( n = x/2 \\), then \\( y = n^2 + 1 \\), where \\( n \\) is an integer because \\( x \\) is an even integer (since \\( x = 2n \\)).\n\nThis seems correct.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 10:**\n\nWe can notice that \\( p = 2 + 2\\sqrt{y - 1} + 2y \\) is an increasing function in \\( y \\). So, let's look for the smallest value of \\( n > 0 \\) such that \\( y = n^2 + 1 \\) doesn't work.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nYes, since \\( y = n^2 + 1 \\), and \\( p = 2 + 2n + 2(n^2 + 1) = 2 + 2n + 2n^2 + 2 = 2n^2 + 2n + 4 \\), which is indeed increasing with \\( n \\).\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 11:**\n\nLet's try \\( n = 31 \\) and see if it works.\n\nThen we have \\( y = 31^2 + 1 = 962 \\).\n\nThat means \\( p = 2 + 2\\sqrt{961} + 2 \\cdot 962 = 2 + 2 \\cdot 31 + 1924 = 2 + 62 + 1924 = 1988 < 2015 \\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nCalculations look correct: \\( \\sqrt{961} = 31 \\), so \\( p = 2 + 2 \\cdot 31 + 2 \\cdot 962 = 2 + 62 + 1924 = 1988 \\), which is less than 2015.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 12:**\n\nNow, let's try \\( n = 32 \\).\n\nWe have \\( y = 32^2 + 1 = 1025 \\).\n\nAnd \\( p = 2 + 2 \\cdot 32 + 2 \\cdot 1025 = 2 + 64 + 2050 = 2116 > 2015 \\). So, \\( n = 32 \\) doesn't work.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nAgain, calculations are correct: \\( p = 2 + 64 + 2050 = 2116 \\), which exceeds 2015.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 13:**\n\nSo, we can conclude that all values of \\( n \\) from 1 to 31 work.\n\nSo our answer is 31 possible values of \\( p \\).",
      "I'll go through the solution step by step and evaluate each part.\n\n**Step 1:** Let's call the length of \\( BC \\) \\( x \\) and the length of \\( AD \\) \\( y \\). The perimeter of the quadrilateral is just \\( 2 + x + 2y \\).\n\n**Analysis:** This step is correct. Given that \\( AB = 2 \\), \\( CD = AD = y \\), and \\( BC = x \\), the perimeter \\( p \\) is indeed \\( AB + BC + CD + DA = 2 + x + y + y = 2 + x + 2y \\).\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 2:** Right, so we want to find all values of \\( 2 + x + 2y \\) that are less than 2015, and \\( x, y \\) are both positive integers.\n\n**Analysis:** This is also correct. The problem specifies that \\( p < 2015 \\), and \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 3:** We can rewrite the equation as \\( x + 2y = p - 2 \\).\n\n**Analysis:** This is a correct algebraic manipulation of the perimeter equation.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 4:** Let's construct a point \\( E \\) such that \\( AE \\) is perpendicular to \\( CD \\). Then \\( AE \\) is equal to \\( x \\).\n\n**Analysis:** This step introduces a new point \\( E \\) to help relate the sides of the quadrilateral. Assuming that \\( E \\) is constructed appropriately, this could be a valid approach. However, the solution doesn't provide a diagram, so we have to take this construction at face value.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 5:** In triangle \\( ADC \\), we have that \\( x = AE \\) is one leg, \\( y = AD \\) is the hypotenuse, and \\( y - 2 = DE \\) is the other leg. Let's apply the Pythagorean theorem there.\n\n**Analysis:** This step seems to be applying the Pythagorean theorem to triangle \\( ADC \\), but there might be some confusion here. Given that \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) have right angles, the relationships between the sides need to be carefully considered. Assuming that \\( E \\) is constructed such that \\( AE \\) is perpendicular to \\( CD \\), and \\( DE = y - 2 \\), this could be valid.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 6:** We get \\( x^2 + (y - 2)^2 = y^2 \\). Which is the same as \\( x^2 = 4y - 4 \\).\n\n**Analysis:** This is a correct application of the Pythagorean theorem to triangle \\( ADC \\).\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 7:** And we know that \\( p = 2 + x + 2y = 2 + 2\\sqrt{y - 1} + 2y \\) must be less than 2015.\n\n**Analysis:** Here, the solution expresses \\( p \\) in terms of \\( y \\), assuming that \\( x = 2\\sqrt{y - 1} \\). This comes from the earlier equation \\( x^2 = 4y - 4 \\), which can be rewritten as \\( x = 2\\sqrt{y - 1} \\). This step seems correct.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 8:** So, \\( 2\\sqrt{y - 1} + 2y < 2013 \\).\n\n**Analysis:** This is a correct inequality derived from the perimeter condition.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 9:** \\( y = 1 \\) doesn't work, since \\( x \\) must be a positive integer.\n\n**Analysis:** When \\( y = 1 \\), \\( x = 2\\sqrt{1 - 1} = 0 \\), which is not a positive integer. So, \\( y = 1 \\) is invalid.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 10:** But \\( y = 2 \\) does work.\n\n**Analysis:** For \\( y = 2 \\), \\( x = 2\\sqrt{2 - 1} = 2 \\), which is a positive integer. So, \\( y = 2 \\) is valid.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 11:** From the equation \\( x^2 = 4y - 4 \\), we get \\( y = (x/2)^2 + 1 \\). So, \\( y \\) is going to be of the form \\( y = n^2 + 1 \\), where \\( n \\) is an integer. We already know that when \\( n = 1, y = 1 \\) and it works.\n\n**Analysis:** There's a slight confusion here. From \\( x^2 = 4y - 4 \\), we can write \\( y = \\frac{x^2 + 4}{4} = \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2 + 1 \\). If we let \\( n = \\frac{x}{2} \\), then \\( y = n^2 + 1 \\). However, \\( n \\) must be an integer because \\( x \\) is a positive integer and \\( x = 2n \\). So, \\( n \\) is indeed an integer.\n\nBut earlier, it was stated that \\( y = 1 \\) doesn't work because \\( x = 0 \\), which is not a positive integer. So, \\( n = 1 \\) corresponds to \\( y = 2 \\), not \\( y = 1 \\).\n\n\\boxed{incorrect}\n\n**Step 12:** We can notice that \\( p = 2 + 2\\sqrt{y - 1} + 2y \\) is an increasing function in \\( y \\). So, let's look for the smallest value of \\( n > 0 \\) such that \\( y = n^2 + 1 \\) doesn't work.\n\n**Analysis:** This seems correct. Since \\( p \\) increases with \\( y \\), we can find the range of \\( n \\) for which \\( p < 2015 \\).\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 13:** Let's try \\( n = 31 \\) and see if it works. Then we have \\( y = 31^2 + 1 = 962 \\). That means \\( p = 2 + 2\\sqrt{961} + 2 \\cdot 962 = 2 + 2 \\cdot 31 + 1924 = 2 + 62 + 1924 = 1988 < 2015 \\).\n\n**Analysis:** This calculation is correct. For \\( n = 31 \\), \\( y = 962 \\), \\( x = 2 \\cdot 31 = 62 \\), and \\( p = 2 + 62 + 1924 = 1988 < 2015 \\).\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 14:** Now, let's try \\( n = 32 \\). We have \\( y = 32^2 + 1 = 1025 \\). And \\( p = 2 + 2 \\cdot 32 + 2 \\cdot 1025 = 2 + 64 + 2050 = 2116 > 2015 \\). So, \\( n = 32 \\) doesn't work.\n\n**Analysis:** This calculation is also correct.

So, our answer is \\( 31 \\) possible values of \\( p \\).\n\n**Analysis:** This conclusion seems correct based on the previous steps. Since \\( n = 31 \\) gives \\( p = 1988 < 2015 \\) and \\( n = 32 \\) gives \\( p = 2116 > 2015 \\), the possible values of \\( n \\) are from \\( 1 \\) to \\( 31 \\), inclusive.\n\n\\boxed{correct}",
      "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see how the proposed solution holds up.

Subtracting 2, we get \\( x + 2y < 2013 \\). So, this step is correct.\n\n**Verdict:** \\(\\boxed{\\text{correct}}\\)\n\n**Step 9:** \\( y = 1 \\) doesn't work, since \\( x \\) must be a positive integer.\n\n**Analysis:** If \\( y = 1 \\), then \\( x^2 = 4(1) - 4 = 0 \\), which implies \\( x = 0 \\), but \\( x \\) is a side length and must be positive. So, \\( y = 1 \\) is invalid.\n\n**Verdict:** \\(\\boxed{\\text{correct}}\\)\n\n**Step 10:** But \\( y = 2 \\) does work.\n\n**Analysis:** For \\( y = 2 \\), \\( x^2 = 4(2) - 4 = 4 \\), so \\( x = 2 \\), which is a positive integer. Hence, \\( y = 2 \\) is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** \\(\\boxed{\\text{correct}}\\)\n\n**Step 11:** From the equation \\( x^2 = 4y - 4 \\), we get \\( y = (x/2)^2 + 1 \\). So, \\( y \\) is of the form \\( y = n^2 + 1 \\), where \\( n = x/2 \\) is an integer.\n\n**Analysis:** Given \\( x^2 = 4y - 4 \\), solving for \\( y \\) gives \\( y = \\frac{x^2 + 4}{4} = \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2 + 1 \\). If \\( x \\) is even, say \\( x = 2n \\), then \\( y = n^2 + 1 \\), which makes sense.\n\n**Verdict:** \\(\\boxed{\\text{correct}}\\)\n\n**Step 12:** We can notice that \\( p = 2 + 2\\sqrt{y - 1} + 2y \\) is an increasing function in \\( y \\). So, let's look for the smallest value of \\( n > 0 \\) such that \\( y = n^2 + 1 \\) doesn't work.\n\n**Analysis:** Since \\( y = n^2 + 1 \\) and \\( p = 2 + 2n + 2(n^2 + 1) = 2 + 2n + 2n^2 + 2 = 2n^2 + 2n + 4 \\), which is indeed increasing with \\( n \\).\n\n**Verdict:** \\(\\boxed{\\text{correct}}\\)\n\n**Step 13:** Let's try \\( n = 31 \\). Then \\( y = 31^2 + 1 = 962 \\). So, \\( p = 2 + 2*31 + 2*962 = 2 + 62 + 1924 = 1988 < 2015 \\).\n\n**Analysis:** Calculation seems correct: \\( p = 2 + 62 + 1924 = 1988 \\), which is less than 2015.\n\n**Verdict:** \\(\\boxed{\\text{correct}}\\)\n\n**Step 14:** Now, let's try \\( n = 32 \\). Then \\( y = 32^2 + 1 = 1025 \\). And \\( p = 2 + 2*32 + 2*1025 = 2 + 64 + 2050 = 2116 > 2015 \\). So, \\( n = 32 \\) doesn't work.\n\n**Analysis:** Again, calculation is correct: \\( p = 2 + 64 + 2050 = 2116 \\), which exceeds 2015.\n\n**Verdict:** \\(\\boxed{\\text{correct}}\\)\n\n**Step 15:** So, we can conclude that all values of \\( n \\) from 1 to 31 work. So, our answer is 31 possible values of \\( p \\).\n\n**Analysis:** Given that \\( n = 31 \\) gives \\( p = 1988 < 2015 \\) and \\( n = 32 \\) gives \\( p = 2116 > 2015 \\), it seems that \\( n \\) can be from 1 to 31 inclusive.\n\n**Verdict:** \\(\\boxed{\\text{correct}}\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{31}\\)\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe proposed solution is largely correct, with a few steps that could benefit from clearer explanations, particularly in the introduction of point \\( E \\) and the relationship between \\( DE \\) and other sides. However, the mathematical deductions and final answer are accurate based on the given steps.",
      "**Step 1: Assigning variables to side lengths**\n\nIn the quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\), with right angles at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), and given \\(AB = 2\\) and \\(CD = AD\\), the solution assigns \\(BC = x\\) and \\(AD = CD = y\\), where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive integers.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis step is correct. It properly assigns variables to the unknown side lengths based on the given conditions. Since \\(CD = AD = y\\), and \\(AB = 2\\), the assignment of variables is appropriate for further analysis.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 2: Expressing the perimeter in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)**\n\nThe perimeter \\(p\\) of the quadrilateral is expressed as \\(p = AB + BC + CD + DA = 2 + x + y + y = 2 + x + 2y\\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis step is correct. It accurately calculates the perimeter by summing all the side lengths, substituting the known values and variables appropriately.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 3: Relating \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) through the Pythagorean theorem**\n\nThe solution introduces a point \\(E\\) such that \\(AE\\) is perpendicular to \\(CD\\), making \\(AE = x\\). Then, in \\(\\triangle AED\\), it applies the Pythagorean theorem: \\(x^2 + (y - 2)^2 = y^2\\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis step is mostly correct but contains a potential misunderstanding. The introduction of point \\(E\\) such that \\(AE\\) is perpendicular to \\(CD\\) is a reasonable approach to relate the sides. However, the assumption that \\(AE = x\\) needs verification.\n\nGiven that \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) have right angles, and \\(AB = 2\\), \\(CD = AD = y\\), the configuration might not directly imply that \\(AE = x\\). It's possible that this assumption is valid, but it should be justified.\n\nAssuming that the configuration allows \\(AE = x\\), the application of the Pythagorean theorem is correct.\n\n\\boxed{caution}\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Pythagorean equation**\n\nFrom \\(x^2 + (y - 2)^2 = y^2\\), the equation simplifies to \\(x^2 = 4y - 4\\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis step is correct. Expanding \\((y - 2)^2\\) gives \\(y^2 - 4y + 4\\), and substituting back into the equation:\n\n\\(x^2 + y^2 - 4y + 4 = y^2\\)\n\nSubtracting \\(y^2\\) from both sides:\n\n\\(x^2 - 4y + 4 = 0\\)\n\nThus, \\(x^2 = 4y - 4\\), which matches the solution's assertion.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 5: Expressing \\(p\\) in terms of \\(y\\)**\n\nGiven \\(p = 2 + x + 2y\\) and \\(x^2 = 4y - 4\\), the solution attempts to express \\(p\\) in terms of \\(y\\). It notes that \\(x = 2\\sqrt{y - 1}\\), assuming \\(y \\geq 1\\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis step is correct, but it should be noted that since \\(x\\) is a positive integer, \\(2\\sqrt{y - 1}\\) must also be an integer. This implies that \\(y - 1\\) must be a perfect square.\n\nMoreover, since \\(x\\) is a positive integer, \\(y\\) must be such that \\(4y - 4\\) is a perfect square, which aligns with the earlier equation \\(x^2 = 4y - 4\\).\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 6: Determining the range of \\(y\\) for \\(p < 2015\\)**\n\nThe solution sets up the inequality \\(2 + 2\\sqrt{y - 1} + 2y < 2015\\) and seeks to find integer values of \\(y\\) that satisfy this condition.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis step is correct. It substitutes \\(x = 2\\sqrt{y - 1}\\) into the perimeter equation and sets up the inequality to find the possible values of \\(y\\) that keep \\(p\\) below 2015.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 7: Testing \\(y = 1\\)**\n\nThe solution mentions that \\(y = 1\\) doesn't work because \\(x\\) must be a positive integer. However, when \\(y = 1\\), \\(x^2 = 4(1) - 4 = 0\\), which implies \\(x = 0\\), which is not a positive integer.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis step is correct. \\(y = 1\\) leads to \\(x = 0\\), which does not satisfy the condition that all side lengths are positive integers.\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 8: Expressing \\(y\\) in terms of \\(n\\)**\n\nThe solution sets \\(y = n^2 + 1\\), where \\(n\\) is an integer, based on the equation \\(x^2 = 4y - 4\\), which can be rewritten as \\(y = \\frac{x^2 + 4}{4} = \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2 + 1\\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis step is correct. By expressing \\(y\\) in terms of \\(n\\), where \\(n = x/2\\), it ensures that \\(y\\) is an integer and \\(x\\) is even, which is consistent with \\(x^2 = 4y - 4\\).\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 9: Testing \\(n = 31\\) and \\(n = 32\\)**\n\nFor \\(n = 31\\), \\(y = 31^2 + 1 = 962\\), and \\(p = 2 + 2(31) + 2(962) = 2 + 62 + 1924 = 1988 < 2015\\).\n\nFor \\(n = 32\\), \\(y = 32^2 + 1 = 1025\\), and \\(p = 2 + 2(32) + 2(1025) = 2 + 64 + 2050 = 2116 > 2015\\), which does not satisfy the condition.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThese calculations are correct. They properly substitute the values of \\(n\\) to find corresponding \\(y\\) and \\(p\\), and check whether \\(p < 2015\\).\n\n\\boxed{correct}\n\n**Step 10: Concluding that \\(n\\) can range from 1 to 31**\n\nBased on the above calculations, the solution concludes that \\(n\\) can take integer values from 1 to 31, inclusive, leading to 31 possible values of \\(p < 2015\\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis conclusion is correct. Since \\(n = 32\\) results in \\(p > 2015\\), and \\(n = 31\\) gives \\(p < 2015\\), the possible integer values of \\(n\\) are from 1 to 31, inclusive.\n\n\\boxed{correct}"
